### private anime streaming website (playground environment) - will most likely contain broken, unstable or unoptimized code
###### you've been warned! feel free to reuse my code or contact me to dev such a website for you if you like what you are seeing. projects I do for fun are the ones I can put thousands of hours into. would love to have a team on my side. ``bs.to`` wasn't interested in automating their website and the ``anfilix.tv`` admin didn't want to give me read-only database access.

**this react.js app was built using:**
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - to set-up the project in less than a minute
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - to style html elements inside the html code using classes
- [ReactPlayer](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player) - to have a solid video player base I can customize
  
and maybe more ready-to-use solutions to come. will keep this updated.

as of now the backend (database, api) remains private.
